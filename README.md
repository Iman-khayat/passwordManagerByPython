Save the file.
2. Run the Script from the Command Line:

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file (password_manager.py). You can use the cd command to change directories.
Once in the correct directory, type the following command and press Enter:
python password_manager.py
